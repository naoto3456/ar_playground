# if you have not installed the needed gems, please do the following:
# gem install sqlite3
# gem install activerecord

require "sqlite3"
require "active_record"

# this line configures ActiveRecord to connect to a sqlite3 database in the same folder named "students.sqlite3"
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(:adapter => "sqlite3", :database => "./students.sqlite3")

# This sets up ActiveRecord to use Ruby OOP with SQL data
class Student < ActiveRecord::Base

# Write your test code here

# 1. Create a new student usinÄ± new and save
# student = Student.new(name: "Harry Potter", email: "harry@example.com", age: 18)
# student.save
# puts '### New, Save ###'
# p student

# 2. Create a new student using create
# student2 = Student.create(name: "Harry Potter", email: "harry2@example.com", age: 18)
# puts '### Create ###'
# p student2
# => #<Student id: 22, name: "Harry Potter", email: "harry2@example.com", age: 18, created_at: "2017-04-05 04:16:43", updated_at: "2017-04-05 04:16:43">


# 3. Select all students
# pay attention to the object that is returned to you, is it a Student object or Active Record relation object?
p Student.all

# Why can't you do Student.name or Student.email?


# 4. Select the first student
# pay attention to the object that is returned to you, is it a Student object or Active Record relation object?
p Student.all.first
p Student.all.first.class
# 5. Select the last student
# pay attention to the object that is returned to you, is it a Student object or Active Record relation object?

# 6. Use each to iterate through the #<ActiveRecord::Relation> object to display the name of each student

# p student.id
# p student.name
